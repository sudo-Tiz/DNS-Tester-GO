## 🚀 Why Go?

[DNS Tester](github.com/dmachard/dns-tester) has been completely rewritten in Go, bringing several improvements:

- **Concurrency**: Native goroutines for parallel DNS queries
- **Resource Efficient**: Compiled binary with lower memory footprint
- **Single Binary**: No runtime dependencies or interpreter needed
- **Production Ready**: Built-in metrics and monitoring support

> 📊 **Performance benchmarks coming soon** - comprehensive results comparing protocols and workloads will be published in upcoming releases.
